# Summary

The `GrIML` Python package is for the post-processing of classified water bodies from satellite imagery. Initial rasterised binary classifications denoting water bodies can be inputted to `GrIML` to convert, filter and merge into a cohesive ice marginal lake vector dataset, populated with useful metadata and analysed with relevant statistical information (\autoref{fig:workflow}).

This package is part of the [ESA GrIML project](https://eo4society.esa.int/projects/griml/) (Investigating Greenland's ice marginal lakes under a changing climate), whose aim is to map and monitor ice marginal lakes across Greenland through a series of annual ice marginal lake inventories (2016-2023). In 2017, 3347 ice marginal lakes were identified in Greenland along the ice margin [@how_greenland-wide_2021;@wiesmann_2017_2021]. Globally, these ice marginal lakes hold up to 0.43 mm of sea level equivalent, which could have a marked impact on future predictions [@shugar_rapid_2020;@carrivick_ice-marginal_2022]. Therefore, they need to be monitored to understand how changes in ice marginal lake water storage affect melt contribution, and how their dynamics evolve under a changing climate. The GrIML workflow was used to make the 2016-2023 inventory series, and will continue to be used to generate inventories in the future.


# Statement of need

`GrIML` meets four main needs to users in the remote sensing and cryospheric science communities:

1. Provide a usable workflow for post-processing of rasterised water body classifications
2. Document the criteria for classifying an ice marginal lake
3. Showcase a transparent workflow that, in turn, produces an open and reproducible ice marginal lake dataset that adheres to the FAIR principles [@wilkinson_fair_2016]
4. Produce inventories that map the areal extent and frequency of ice marginal lakes across Greenland, which demonstrate ice marginal lake evolution under a changing cliamte

There have been many different approaches to classifying ice marginal lakes with remote sensing techniques [@shugar_rapid_2020;@rick_dam_2022]. Packages exist for handling satellite and spatial data, such as GrIML's two key dependencies, Geopandas [@kelsey_geopandas_2020] and Rasterio [@gillies_rasterio_2019], as well as others (e.g. SentinelHub, Google Earth Engine). Remote sensing object classification and post-processing routines are usually available in connection with scientific publications, however, few are available as open, deployable packages. The GrIML post-processing Python package addresses this gap, for the benefit of the future generation of ice marginal lake inventories and for others in the scientific community to adapt and use themselves.
