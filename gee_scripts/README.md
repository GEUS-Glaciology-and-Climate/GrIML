# Google Earth Engine scripts

The scripts here are used alongside the GrIML Python package to:

1. **lake_classification**: Perform the initial raster classification of water bodies from Sentinel-1 and Sentinel-2 imagery, and the ArcticDEM 

2. **lake_temperature_estimation**: Calculate a surface water temperature estimate for each lake defined in an ice-marginal lake inventory

These scripts are provided both in javascript (to be used in the [Google Earth Engine portal](https://code.earthengine.google.com/)) and Python (using the [Google Earth Engine API](https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/guides/python_install))
