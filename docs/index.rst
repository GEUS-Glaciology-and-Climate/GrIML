GrIML
=====

The **GrIML** processing package is for classifying water bodies from satellite imagery using a multi-sensor, multi-method remote sensing approach. It has been used to produce the Greenland ice marginal lake inventory series, which maps the presence and extents of water bodies across Greenland that share a margin with the Greenland Ice Sheet and/or the surroudning ice caps and periphery glaciers since 2016.
